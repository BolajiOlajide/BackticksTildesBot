# BackticksTildesBot

A fork of [@ireade](https://github.com/ireade)'s `botofcode`.

A twitter bot for [Backticks & Tildes](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes).

I'm gonna have to pend this for sometime until I figure out a workaround to track links
on twitter, if it was possible to connect a custom domain to a publication, it'd be great
but medium masks all links with a `link.medium.com` hyperlink.
